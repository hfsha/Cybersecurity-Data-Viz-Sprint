## 📦 How to Run Locally

> **Don’t open `index.html` directly!**  
> Modern browsers block local file access for JS modules and data.  
> **You must use a local server.**

### The Fastest Way (with Python):

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

Or, double-click `start-server.bat` if you’re on Windows!
